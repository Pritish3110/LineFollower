# üõ§Ô∏è Line Following Robot with Obstacle Detection

This project is a simple yet effective **Line Following Robot** built using an Arduino UNO, L298N motor driver, IR sensors, and an ultrasonic sensor. The robot is designed to follow a black line on the ground and stop or take action when an obstacle is detected in front of it.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle

1. **Line Following**:  
   The two IR sensors continuously check the surface. When both sensors are on the black line, the robot moves forward. If the line veers left or right, the robot adjusts its direction accordingly.

2. **Obstacle Detection**:  
   The ultrasonic sensor measures distance to obstacles. If an object is detected within a certain threshold (e.g. 10 cm), the robot stops or takes an alternate action.

3. **Power System**:  
   The system is powered by two 18650 batteries in series (7.4V). A **LM7805 voltage regulator** is used to deliver a safe and stable 5V output to the Arduino and sensors. Capacitors smooth out the voltage fluctuations.
